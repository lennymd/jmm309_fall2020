Hey I want to answer this question: **What team won the most at Monaco?**

I'm thinking of a story that goes:

1. Team A won the most at monaco
1. Team A's been in F1 since blah
1. What driver has the best monaco record. What about the best lap?
1. History of Monaco in F1. What kind of a circuit is it.

## Loading Stuff

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's load the data too:

```{r}
race_results <- read_csv("../data/race_results_statsf1.csv")
```
@@ Go back and clean this data if you want@@

```{r}
monaco <- filter(race_results, race_name == "Monaco")
monaco
```

Now let's find the winners:

```{r}
monaco_winners <- filter(monaco, position == '1')
```

Let's group by team:

```{r}
monaco_winning_teams <- group_by(monaco_winners, driver) 
monaco_winning_teams_count <- summarize(monaco_winning_teams, count=n())
arrange(monaco_winning_teams_count, desc(count))
```
